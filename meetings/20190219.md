## Completed this week ##
### All group members ###
* Read Raft and Spanner paper, discussed pro's and con's.
	* Spanner uses TrueTime API to assign a commit timestamps to transactions in the way that it satisfies external consistency: if a transaction T1 commits before another transaction T2 starts, then T1’s commit timestamp is smaller than T2’s.
	* Raft is an easy to understand protocol for determining distributed consensus that deals with issues that may occur in such scenario.
* Come up with direction for the implementation of distributed file server
	* Spanner was deemed too complicated for the purpose of this project, whereas Raft was designed to be simpler to understand and implement.
	* Use Docker to simulate the multi-server settings
	* Every server will have a replicate of all transaction logs (the bids), and use Raft protocol to determine which server will be the leader to update the logs.


## This week ##
* Implement the backbone of our distributed server, referencing existing Raft Libraries.
* Implement basic auction functionalities
